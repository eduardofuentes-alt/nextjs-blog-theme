## User-Friendly Interface

Grass will grow
If you should take my child Lord
Give my hands strength to dig his grave
cover him with earth
Lord send a little rain
For grass will grow

If my house should burn down
So that the ashes sting the nostrils
Making the eyes weep
Then Lord send a little rain
For grass will grow

But Lord do not send me
Madness
I ask for tears
Do not send me moon hard madness
To lodge snug in my skull
I would you sent me hordes of horses
Galloping
Crushing
But do not break
The yolk of the moon on me.

– by Jonathan Kariara (1935 – 1993)

It’s been twenty years, Uncle Jonathan and  grass did indeed grow.  But we remember always: the house at Westlands,  the food and juices, the generosity, the charm, the jokes, your love, your love and our happiness.  You, everyday.

## Vector-Based Design for Scalability

Vector-based design is essential in UI, where icons and graphics need to scale across various screen sizes. Sketch’s vector capabilities ensure that designs stay sharp and consistent, no matter the device or resolution. Designers can create everything from tiny icons to full-screen mockups without losing image quality.

## Symbols and Reusable Components

One of Sketch’s most beloved features is its Symbols feature, which lets designers create reusable components. This is a game-changer for maintaining consistency across projects, as elements like buttons, icons, and navigation bars can be updated once and reflected throughout the design. The ability to nest Symbols and create overrides adds even more flexibility, enabling designers to craft complex design systems with ease.

## Powerful Plugins and Integrations

Sketch’s extensive plugin library is unmatched, offering tools for everything from animations to code export. Tools like Anima, Stark, and Craft by InVision extend Sketch’s functionality, enabling designers to customize the tool to their workflow. The robust plugin ecosystem allows designers to stay in Sketch while integrating seamlessly with prototyping, developer handoff, and collaboration tools, making Sketch highly adaptable for varied design processes.

## Cloud Collaboration and Sharing

Collaboration is critical in modern design workflows, and Sketch’s Cloud feature makes it easy to share work with clients, teammates, and developers. The ability to upload designs to the cloud allows for real-time feedback and streamlined developer handoff. Sketch Cloud supports commenting, version control, and asset exporting, making remote collaboration a breeze.
